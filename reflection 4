Learning about functions was arguably the most important lesson yet as it reveals further possibilites of python as a language. I learned how to acces different data that
is aloready implemented in the language with thed usage of special commands to access the archive. Also, I learned hwo to access some information that is within the 
language itself and not the archive. Overall, this lesson was balueable as well as eye-opening to me, when considering my knowledge of Python.
