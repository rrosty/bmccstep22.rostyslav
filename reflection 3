n today's coding lesson I learned that certain codes can have a specific order of operation, depending on wether the statement is true or false. There are different ways 
to make the code flow in the direction that follows logic with the usage of things like "if" and "elif". Making a code that would follow a logical order of operations 
be really usefull in development of apps that are closely linked with mathematics. Overall, I really enjoyed today's lesson, and I hope I can utilize the skill in the 
nearest future!
